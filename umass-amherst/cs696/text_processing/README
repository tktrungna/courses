1) extractCUB.m extracting data (image, labeled, properties ...) from CUB dataset
    generating ../mat/image.mat, attr.mat, classes.mat, attr_type.mat files

2) buildDict.m bulding vbag-of-word vector for articles about birds
    generating ../mat/bow_vector.mat

3) buildFeature.m generate value of attributes of each kind of bird
    generating ../mat/attribute.mat

4) buildData.m generate crossvalidation data for training and testing model
    generating ../mat/crossvalid.mat


5) svm_run.m % Training SVM classifiers and testing accuracy

6) svm_run2.m % Training SVM classifiers and testing accuracy on the first 
    % training-testing dataset, generate figures
    
7) runDiffThreshold.m changing value of threshold to generate different values of attribute, compare
    accuracy with baseline's accuracy (the number of 0s labels of dataset)

8) runDiffSVMThreshold.m % using liblinear's svm to train and test result, changing svm's
    % thresvalue to figure precision and recall rates
    
9) groupFeature.m from 312 attributes from dataset, group to subset with the same kind of attribute,    such as color_red, color_green ... gonna be grouped as color attribute

10) runGroupAttribute.m run the whole training and testing process on grouped attributes
